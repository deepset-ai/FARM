# FARM

(**F**ramework for **A**dapting **R**epresentation **M**odels)  

## What is it?
FARM makes cutting edge **Transfer Learning** for NLP simple. 
It is a home for all species of pretrained language models (e.g. BERT) that can be adapted to different down-stream
tasks (e.g. NER) by simply switching the prediction head.
The standardized interfaces for language models and prediction heads allow a flexible extension by researchers and an easy adaptation for practitioners.
Additional experiment tracking and visualizations support you along the way to adapt a SOTA model to your own NLP problem and showcase it as a PoC.  

## Core features  

- Easy adaptation of pretrained language models (e.g. BERT) to your own use case
- Modular design of language model and prediction heads
- Easy Experiment tracking & execution
- Simple deployment and visualization to showcase your PoC model 


## How to use it?
