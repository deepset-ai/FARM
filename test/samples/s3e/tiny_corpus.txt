a woman is walking on the street .
im a more happier person after discovering the button ! .
but , if you are looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
for the price it is a well spent investment ! .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
it is very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i have had .
it plays alternate video formats cads cods very well .
and amazon . com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong ? .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd fill of files ( mp3s ) .
it sure does ! .
