The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.	4
"I am so pleased with this top! it is slightly fitted - i am 5'3"", 110 lbs, - and have trouble finding tops that are flattering but not too form fitting. also it is 100% cotton, which is a definite plus. as of now it is my go-to top - looks great with jeans or leggings."	5
I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i	5
How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.	5
Very pretty, romantic	3
I thought this would be so clean looking, in a theory/vince. menswear way, but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark, sleeves are too long, and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas, this is going back, and my search for the perfect coat continues!	3
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.	5
I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!	3
This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable	2
I love the fit of this dress! the fabric is thick and the shape of it is so adorable. i usually don't like bright colors, but i got it in red and it's just so charming. can't wait to wear it out!	5
This runs tts - maybe a little on the large side. i typically wear between a small and a medium (or 6 and 8), and the small was a perfect fit. this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks. (i drink a ton of water) this one is relatively easy - it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and it's super easy and not awkward at all. i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau	5
My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.	5
"Great fit in waist, hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.  i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves."	4
Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.	5
"I bought these pants in red after trying them on in store. they are soft and company. they have a loose fit, which is typical for chinos, so they pair best with a fitted top. i'm 5'2"""" and these were the perfect length when rolled. they run a bit big and stretch out though and eventually were too baggy. i loved them though so i ordered them in a size down. i'd definitely buy them in other colors too if they become available in my size!"	5
"I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter"	5
"Wearing this dress for the first time now, and i love it! soft material, comfortable, and easy to dress up or dress down, making it good for all kinds of different occasions.  i was a bit nervous about the initial purchase due to other reviews saying this dress isn't great for pear shapes, but i whole-heartedly disagree! i think it actually just needs a belt for those of us with particularly curvy figures - i'm wearing a belt around my natural waist, and have bloused out the top and it looks g"	5
"Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed."	2
This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!	4
"I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige - these jeans are different than the regular paige styles, in all the best ways. they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering; the waist is high, so my tush doesn't hang out when i sit - i love them. i am 5'8"" and 140lbs and these are long. i can only wear them with heels, but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it!"	5
...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down	4
It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly. i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory, it has some pinkish tones to it, it is absolutely beautiful. looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans.	5
I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.	5
"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"	5
I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.	5
"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy, so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i returned it for a size 2, which fit much better. in the end, i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape, and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made, but it just wasn't for me."	3
I love this top! the fabric is so soft and it's perfect with white pants. yes it does run wide and is short, but if you get the correct size it looks just like it does on the model!	5
I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch	4
I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.	5
Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.	4
I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate	5
I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted, it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband, as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue, but the top stayed put.  overall, very pleased.	4
Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.	1
It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue, but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i'm very happy with this, though i'm also very very happy i got thi	3
Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.	3
I just received this dress after ordering it online and i'm already in love. the fit is perfect - i tend to have issues with bust areas of dresses being too small and this fits just right. the material is light and perfect for southwest florida.	5
The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.	4
"Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color , but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall, but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and"	5
So, this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said, all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely, and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!	3
I bought this dress tonight and i love it! the fit is perfect and the color is perfect! the dress runs true to size, as all dolan products do. i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots. love this dress and think everyone should give it a try!	5
This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.	5
I love this cozy and comfy top. it is oversized as the name says and implies - but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small - and i'm glad i did. it is boxy and oversized - but also short. the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is - and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy.	5
-i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an	4
These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.	5
"I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up. (and this brand has run small in the past) i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width either way, this is a keeper!! it is adorable on, comfortable, my t-back bra works perfectly, very flattering, and way better than expected the shorts length is a little longer than pictured, but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an"	5
This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m	5
I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.	5
I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co	5
I have worn this beautiful sweater with all kinds of outfits! i love to dress it down with ripped skinnies, booties, & some long layered necklaces. i did not have as big an aversion to the itch factor as the other reviewer, but it is definitely not super soft or anything. it fit a little larger than true to size in my opinion. i should've ordered a small. i think it's a very unique winter staple that matches almost every single thing in my wardrobe. it's versatile, snuggly, & warm i'd recommend	4
