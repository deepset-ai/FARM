I love, love this dress except for the armpits. if they had just made the armpits a normal round shape with normal openings, the dress would have been perfection. so audrey hepburn!! but i had to say no. i really wish they would redo this dress with normal arm openings. i think it would sell like crazy.	4
I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.	2
Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!	5
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.	3
Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.	2
Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.	5
I love the style of this dress, comfortable but chic, and it feels great!	5
This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!	5
A culotte and basketball short hybrid. these culottes are heaven....very comfortable. the are great on windy summer days or walking around the city (between the buildings are like wind tunnels). the waist does run alittle large...i have a 29-30in waist and the medium petite fit my lower waist, but is large on my natural waist...a small petite would be better, so size down one size on the waist. plus the waist band is stretchy, so there is a lot of forgiveness in sizing down. plus the petite's le	5
Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!	5
The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.	3
"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n"	5
The sweater is very soft. it has an interesting pattern. i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts. it's definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter.	5
This is my fourth amadi piece from retailer.  i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces (like the lola jumpsuit, crossfront lola dress and others).  this dress has the same crossover top design, with a slim maxi silhouette.    the fabric is 97% rayon and 3% nylon with a neat texture that doesn't come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles.  it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie	5
"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers.
i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"	4
This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.	5
This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.	5
I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.	5
This does run big but because it is cotton, it easily shrinks in the dryer. i love it! i do wish the color was more saturated/deeper.	4
"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""	5
Such a cute top! i got the black with tiny car faces on it. absolutely adore it.	5
"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they don't get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i haven't worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte"	5
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this	5
"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs, curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on, they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite, curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area."	3
I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!	4
Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam	2
"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.
i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well"	5
I got this in blush pink and the details are very pretty. the dress is wide, might have a tailor bring it in on the sides, but its very comfortable and i like that it covers my arms a bit, but still keeps you cool.	4
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."	3
Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w	5
This is an eye-catching top and cute design. the xs fit but was extra-billowy for my taste...if you notice on the model it also shows that the back is not fitted and flows behind wider than is normal...a great and breezy style, but for me, sadly it overwhelmed my short frame. the bottom of the ruffle hit me just at the hips which made the top also a tad too short for my taste. i am sure on others it will work and look amazing.	4
Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.	5
This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.	5
I thought i'd be the exception - these pants are super cute - great fabric and color - kind of loved them - but they do run small - by about one size. just something to keep in mind while ordering. other than that - they are lovely, well-made pants.	5
The shirt was cute. i'm very petite and it ran very wide so didn't fit me well.	3
This dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale. i have worn this dress one time, thinking that i would love it. the problem is that as i wore it, the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half. the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape. i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want.	3
I have many pairs of ag jeans -- mostly stevie's & harper's -- and while they're comfortable, i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day. these jeans are different. the fabric is very, very soft & feels like it's been washed & worn dozens of times. but the color & finish of the jean looks polished & spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday. and the fit is perfect, once i went up a size. slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting. my regular stevie's always fe	5
"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)"	2
These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies, if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.	5
Aaaaaaamazing tunic, it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on. the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top.	5
This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l, sometimes xl in tops from retailer, but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top, and now that it's on sale, the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!	4
I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.	5
I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin	5
The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return.	3
"My only complaint is that there is no lining. it also came very wrinkly and i need to figure out how to steam it.  however the fit is perfect (tts) and it is so very flattering!"	5
I hated to send this dress back, but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress. sent it back. it is meant for taller and more slender women.	4
This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.	4
