I love, love this dress except for the armpits. if they had just made the armpits a normal round shape with normal openings, the dress would have been perfection. so audrey hepburn!! but i had to say no. i really wish they would redo this dress with normal arm openings. i think it would sell like crazy.	4
I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.	2
Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!	5
I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.	3
