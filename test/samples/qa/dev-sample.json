The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the original meaning of the word Norman?", "id": "56dde0379a695914005b9636", "answers": [{"text": "Viking", "answer_start": 341}, {"text": "Norseman, Viking", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "Norseman, Viking", "answer_start": 331}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the Latin version of the word Norman first recorded?", "id": "56dde0379a695914005b9637", "answers": [{"text": "9th century", "answer_start": 309}, {"text": "9th century", "answer_start": 309}, {"text": "9th century", "answer_start": 309}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "\"Normans\"", "answer_start": 17}], "question": "What name comes from the English words Normans/Normanz?", "id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb89", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "9th century", "answer_start": 309}], "question": "When was the French version of the word Norman first recorded?", "id": "5ad3ab70604f3c001a3feb8a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The English name \"Normans\" comes from the French words Normans/Normanz, plural of Normant, modern French normand, which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann \"Northman\" or directly from Old Norse Nor\u00f0ma\u00f0r, Latinized variously as Nortmannus, Normannus, or Nordmannus (recorded in Medieval Latin, 9th century) to mean \"Norseman, Viking\"."}]}]}
