    The FARM Inferencer has a high performance non-blocking streaming mode for large scale inference use cases. With
    this mode, the dicts parameter can optionally be a Python generator object that yield dicts, thus avoiding loading
    dicts in memory. The inference_from_dicts() method returns a generator that yield predictions. To use streaming,
    set the streaming param to True and determine optimal multiprocessing_chunksize by performing speed benchmarks.
